# Ensolvers Coding Challenge

A Notes CRUD Single Page Application
I chose to make this SPA with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\


## To run de app:
First, to compile and run the application you need to download its dependencies using `npm i` or `npm install`
After that, and as i'm using CRA, you can use it's default commands:

- **`npm start`** to run the app in the development mode.\
- **`npm run build`** to build app for production in an optimized build folder.
